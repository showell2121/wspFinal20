        <p class="lead">Welcome to Help-A-Neighbor, where you can find community resources provided by 
            neighbors for neighbors. Here, anyone who is currently deprived of basic needs can request 
            a specific need and another person can fulfill this need, all at the touch of a button. 
            These needs can range from food, toiletries, housing, jobs, childcare, transportation, to 
            anything one might need at a time of struggle. All we ask is that the need is of good taste, 
            be a real need, and be acceptable for all eyes to see; this really is a place to be the hands 
            and feet of Jesus. If you need a job, list your skills. If you have one to offer, share that 
            job opportunity. And, by the way, if your business is struggling, feel free to share the beauty 
            of what your business does. Everyone who needs a helping hand is welcome here. By the way, 
            while youâ€™re here, go ahead and Help-A-Neighbor.</p>
